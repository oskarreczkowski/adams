								<h2 class="portfolio-sectionheader" id="intro-header">The Bandra Report</h2>
								<p class="portfolio-body">I created this album cover for the Bandra Report, a jazz fusion rock band based in Detroit. The name "Bandra" comes from a train line in India where there was a severe accident. The client wanted to combine the aspect of the tragedy and precariousness of life with the beauty and energy of downtown Detroit culture. I wanted to have every element in the cover be off-kilter like things were free falling but ground it in the peacefulness of the simple bisected layout and the circle. This represented what their music felt like to me- smooth chaos.

										<h2 class="">Character Designs</h2>
										<span class="">Some characters I created while taking Nate Wragg’s character design class. I loved the simplicity of his design philosophy, which revolved around the echoing of simple shapes throughout the various levels of a design from minor details to the larger silhouettes. It reminded me of the self-similarity principle in mathematics.</span>
