										<h2 class="">Spec Project: Gap Mobile App Redesign</h2>
										<span class="">As a UI/UX exercise for a job interview, I redesigned the Gap iPhone app, which at the time was in dire need of an upgrade. The app was hindered by pages that were too long, important features or content that were not given proper emphasis, and clunky navigation. There was also a lack of recognition of their core demographic of cost-conscious shoppers, which I tried to address through a personalized sales notification page.</span>
