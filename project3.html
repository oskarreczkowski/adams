								<h2 class="portfolio-sectionheader" id="intro-header">Case Study:<br/> The ROI of Outsourcing Your Billing Ebook</h2>
								<p class="portfolio-body" id="intro-paragraph">Print collateral has pros and cons from a visual design perspective. It is liberating to not be weighed down by factors like dealing with multiple display sizes and interactivity in responsive web design. On the other hand, a format like an ebook is limited to one of the most boring dimensions known to man: 8.5 x 11in.</p>
								<h2 class="portfolio-sectionheader">What I Inherited</h2>
								<p class="portfolio-body">Here’s what the previous agency came up with. While the grid is predictable and consistent and easily repeatable, it feels like this document was made 10 years ago- not the kind of tone we want to convey especially for a healthcare software company that is trying to disrupt and innovate an industry that is inundated with poor design as it is.</p>

								<h2 class="portfolio-sectionheader">Don’t Be Square</h2>
								<p class="portfolio-body">So I decided to break the grid. Many of these guides were also relatively sparse on content so the grid, which is better utilized for content heavy designs, seemed unnecessary. Instead, I used the negative space of the illustrations to dictate where text should go and the flexible layout allowed us to modulate the emphases of specific points with a level of naturalness and specificity that might have been harder with a strict grid. <br/> With every page I tried to distill down the content to the most important point. Never over designing when unnecessary, I spaced the content as it made sense in terms of the flow of the page and I consulted frequently with our Content Marketing Manager to make sure her point was being told clearly and concisely. I always start these projects with a careful read of the copy, trying to distill each section to the most concise and impactful point.</p>								<section class="section fade-in outview">

								<h2 class="portfolio-sectionheader">Illustration</h2>
								<p class="portfolio-body">Echoing Kareo's circular shape language created a consistency and distinctiveness to the illustrations and layouts. Everything from the characters to the layouts and even the font style uses a consistent circular treatment.<br/> When it comes to illustrations, more is not always better. Sometimes, well-placed negative space can tell more of a story and add more beauty than a thousand dollar illustration. <br/> We also didn’t have unlimited budget and time for these ebooks, so we had to be able to use our limited illustrative assets and resources in a way that made it feel we were a much better resourced design organization.</p>
