								<h2 class="portfolio-sectionheader" id="intro-header">Adventure Awaits Meetup Group Promo</h2>
								<p class="portfolio-body">In 2018, I made a goal for myself to learn to shoot and edit a video from start to finish for the first time. I thought a great first project to take on was a mini-promo/documentary about my friend’s nature meetup group, Adventure Awaits. However, it quickly became very apparent to me why people hire entire crews for these projects.
								<br/>
								But stubbornly, I was committed to learning every aspect of the process (not to mention, I had no interest in shelling out thousands on crew members for a test project). Thankfully, we’re living during a time when our phones can record decent video, and I just needed a couple extra tools to help me. Keep scrolling to see how I made it!

								<h2 class="portfolio-sectionheader">One Man (Mobile) Crew</h2>
								<p class="portfolio-body">I knew if I was going to spend all this time making this video I at least wanted to get some semblance of a cinematic feeling. Thankfully, when I started this project I entered the nascent market of mobile filmmaking right as companies dedicated to this  niche industry started taking off.
								<br/>
								First off was the gimbal. My sister bought me the Zhiyun Smooth Q, which worked like magic and was an absolute lifesaver. Next, I bought Tele and Wide lenses from a small, up and coming startup called Moment. And finally, I bought a mini external Rode mic as well as a Zoom H1 for interviews. Altogether, my set of equipment was so tiny I was able to fit everything in a single bag.

								<h2 class="portfolio-sectionheader" >The Shoot</h2>
								<p class="portfolio-body">With my miniature crew in hand (literally), I went off on an adventure with my friend, Peter, following him to various national parks, including Joshua Tree, Great Sequoia, and Death Valley along with his meetup group. In all my excitement over the technical details, I did not prepare myself as an interviewer. I thought the answers from my unwitting subject would just flow with little prompting but boy was I wrong.</p>

								<h2 class="portfolio-sectionheader" >Post-Production</h2>
								<p class="portfolio-body">Finally, came the most painful but also the most enlightening part of learning the filmmaking process- post-production. The project was a great and brutal introduction to editing and sound design in Premiere Pro and Audition. I also completely underestimated how much one has to predetermine the story arc of a documentary prior to even filming one frame. Like everything else in this process, I learned this the hard way as I trashed hours of pretty but unusable footage. Ultimately, I found a through-line through our various interviews and realized Peter's adventures out in nature could be seen as a symbolic exploration into himself. The desert representing searching/wandering, the mountains representing vision/insight, the ocean representing peace/contemplation, etc.</p>
