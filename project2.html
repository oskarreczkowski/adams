								<p class="portfolio-body">The Kareo Billing Company page was sorely in need of a redesign. Engagement on the CTAs were paltry, the page structure was messy, etc. I worked with our Billing Company Channel Marketing Manager to redesign the page and this is what I came up. Keep scrolling to see how it was built!</p>

								<h2 class="portfolio-sectionheader">The Product Logo</h2>
								<p class="portfolio-body">When I joined Kareo, our Billing Company product did not have a distinct brand. So the first step was to create a product logo. I worked with one of our product designers to come up with a logo that was in line with the our existing product logos. Each product logo communicates at two levels. The first level is literal- (i.e. Kareo Clinical is a band-aid). The second level, the silhouette, is a more abstract signifier (i.e. Kareo Clinical is a cross, signifying hospitals/medical practices). Given that precedent, we chose the following logo, which is a literal representation of a billing company office but also a bar graph, signifying data and analytics, which fits the role of our Billing Companies.</p>

								<h2 class="portfolio-sectionheader">Product Intro</h2>
								<p class="portfolio-body">One of Kareo’s main selling points is the comprehensiveness of our suite of products. Gone are the days when practices have to purchase point solutions from separate companies for each aspect of their practice (electronic health record software from one company, billing software from another, etc.). I wanted to communicate the comprehensiveness of our solutions while simultaneously communicating the integration and simplicity of our platform. I decided the easiest way to communicate this was through abstracted UI from various features and have them converge on our simple interface.</p>

								<h2 class="portfolio-sectionheader">Layout: Softening the Transitions</h2>
								<p class="portfolio-body">While the easy approach to any page is to stack vertical blocks of content, I felt we could increase engagement and encourage scrolling by not having as many distinct edges to the bottoms of each section. Furthermore, Kareo’s brand (and logo itself) is comprised of curves, which connotes a feeling of softness and ease. I thought we could extend this brand feeling and language through softer transitions and curves in the page layouts themselves.</p>

								<h2 class="portfolio-sectionheader">Feature Illustrations</h2>
								<p class="portfolio-body" style="margin-bottom:20px">Our original features section was a simple, stale block of descriptions and links and, to no one’s surprise, it didn’t attract much engagement. As I had already used product videos and screenshots in the product overview section above it, I thought the best approach to draw interest as well as communicate the value of our features holistically was to use an animated illustration. Again, we wanted to continue echo the integrated workflow of our platform.</p>

								<h2 class="portfolio-sectionheader">Measuring Our Success</h2>
								<p class="portfolio-body">Making things look pretty is fine and all but did it actually change anything? We set up recordings in Hotjar and found the following: 1) average page scroll length went well past the height of the original page with 25% of users reaching almost the bottom of the page; 2) we increased engagement on our main CTAs (Schedule Demo buttons at the top and bottom of the pages) from 2% in the previous version to 4% in the updated page. Not bad considering we launched ZERO new features!</p>
