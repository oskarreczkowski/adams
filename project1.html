								<p class="portfolio-body" id="intro-paragraph">Since 2015, I have been working as the Lead Visual Designer in the Brand Marketing department at Kareo. Working with a team of three designers and a developer, I designed and scaled the production of our web pages, print collateral, and event designs. Functioning as an internal design agency for the entire organization, my team and I were involved in the whole spectrum of the prospect/customer pipeline, including Sales, Onboarding, and Product. <br/>
								While the initial visual style was set by a previous agency just prior to my arrival, I was tasked with expanding the visual vocabulary of the brand, scaling our design processes and closing gaps in the branding.

								<h2 class="portfolio-sectionheader">Color and Typography</h2>
								<p class="portfolio-body">The colors from the original style guide seemed a little stale and lacking some vibrancy. There was also an inconsistency with the colors used in the actual product logos. I introduced subtle gradients to add depth, especially in our print layouts.<br/>
								While general text styles were in place before I came on board, the style guide was lacking in an exact hierarchy. I added a more prescriptive guide for our website as well as standardized the presentation of our product logos.<br/>
								For our content marketing pieces (i.e. ebooks and infographics), I felt we needed a more approachable, playful font that could catch people’s attention and convey a couple things that our main font, Source Sans Pro, was not able to. I felt League Spartan Bold communicated that we were fresh, energetic, and that our content was engaging and different from other stale content that prospects are accustomed to in the medical billing industry.

								<h2 class="portfolio-sectionheader">Product Branding</h2>
								<p class="portfolio-body">Kareo added four products/services during my tenure and I had to reconsider the hierarchy of our product branding. Before I joined, there was not a standard treatment for the products other than the product icons for our three core products. I first created a standard font-treatment for the product names.<br/>
								We also had to decide how to visually differentiate the hierarchy of our products. Kareo added four products/services that were considered “extensions” of our core products, but not full on products in themselves. We went back and forth on whether we should style these like our core product icons, style them differently, or just not create icons in general. Eventually, I decided a middle-point that made sense was to use a line treatment vs the higher-fidelity treatment of the core products.

										<h2 class="">Illustration</h2>
										<span class="">When I joined Kareo, I felt our brand didn’t incorporate illustrations enough. Especially in an industry where the software itself is not intrinsically interesting and historically has not been treated with much visual flair, I knew we had to separate ourselves visually in some way from the competition. I also wanted a clearer and more customizable way to communicate some of our solutions which would be hard to express concisely in a photo. With help from illustration studio, RADIO, we created our illustration style.</span>

										<h2 class="">Collateral Redesign</h2>
										<span class="">In the process of updating the look of our print collateral, I realized we needed to simplify our template. We initially created color coded templates based on our three core products: red for Kareo Clinical, green for Kareo Billing, and blue for Kareo Engage. However, the company’s strategy and messaging quickly evolved from selling point solutions to selling an integrated platform.<br/>
										To address this, I simplified our template using a standard header that echoed our logo and simplified our print color scheme to our Kareo orange. I thought this solution solved three problems 1) it broke the boring, boxy sales sheet layout 2) it created less confusion for the various customers who viewed these documents from varying levels of context and 3) it allowed easier scaling of new document templates and simplified the number of design decisions that needed to be made with each document.

										<h2 class="">Content Marketing</h2>
										<span class="">A big portion of our marketing initiatives centered around our ebooks and infographics. We used more illustrations, vibrant colors, and less-dense layouts in these materials compared to our sales materials as the primary audience were prospects varying levels of interest in purchasing software. I introduced the "League Spartan" font into these pieces as the relatively thin weight of "Source Sans Pro" was not as visible in social media thumbnail images and did not draw enough visual weight compared to the visuals.</span>
