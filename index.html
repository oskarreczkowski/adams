								<p class="portfolio-body" id="intro-paragraph">Since 2015, I have been working as the Lead Visual Designer in the Brand Marketing department at Kareo. Working with a team of three designers and a developer, I designed and scaled the production of our web pages, print collateral, and event designs. Functioning as an internal design agency for the entire organization, my team and I were involved in the whole spectrum of the prospect/customer pipeline, including Sales, Onboarding, and Product. <br/>
								While the initial visual style was set by a previous agency just prior to my arrival, I was tasked with expanding the visual vocabulary of the brand, scaling our design processes and closing gaps in the branding.
								</p>

								<h2 class="portfolio-sectionheader">Color and Typography</h2>
								<p class="portfolio-body">The colors from the original style guide seemed a little stale and lacking some vibrancy. There was also an inconsistency with the colors used in the actual product logos. I also introduced subtle gradients to add depth, especially in our print layouts.<br/>
								While general text styles were in place before I came on board, the style guide was lacking in an exact hierarchy. I added a more prescriptive guide for our website as well as standardized the presentation of our product logos.<br/>
								For our content marketing pieces (i.e. ebooks and infographics), I felt we needed a more approachable, playful font that could catch people’s attention and convey a couple things that our main font, Source Sans Pro, was not able to. I felt League Spartan Bold communicated that we were fresh, energetic, and that our content was engaging and different from other stale content that prospects are accustomed to in the medical billing industry.

								<h2 class="portfolio-sectionheader">Product Branding</h2>
								<p class="portfolio-body">Kareo added four products/services during my tenure and I had to reconsider the hierarchy of our product branding. Before I joined, there was not a standard treatment for the products other than the product icons for our three core products. I first created a standard font-treatment for the product names.<br/>
								Now, we had to decide how to visually differentiate the hierarchy of our products. Kareo added four products/services that were considered “extensions” of our core products, but not full on products in themselves. We went back and forth on whether we should style these like our core product icons, style them differently, or just not create icons in general. Eventually, I decided a middle-point that made sense was to use a line treatment vs the higher-fidelity treatment of the core products.

										<h2 class="">Illustration</h2>
										<span class="">When I joined Kareo, I felt our site didn’t incorporate illustrations enough. Especially in an industry where the software itself is not intrinsically interesting and historically has not been treated with much visual flair, I knew we had to separate ourselves visually in some way from the competition. I also wanted a clearer and more customizable way to communicate some of our solutions which would be hard to express concisely in a photo. With help from illustration studio, RADIO, we created our illustration style.</span>

										<h2 class="">Collateral Redesign</h2>
										<span class="">In the process of updating the look of our print collateral, I realized we needed to simplify our template. We initially created color coded templates based on our three core products: red for Kareo Clinical, green for Kareo Billing, and blue for Kareo Engage. However, the company’s strategy and messaging quickly evolved from selling point solutions to selling an integrated platform.<br/>
										To address this, I simplified our template using a standard header that echoed our logo and simplified our print color scheme to our Kareo orange. I thought this solution solved three problems 1) it broke the boring, boxy sales sheet layout 2) it created less confusion for the various customers who viewed these documents from varying levels of context and 3) it allowed easier scaling of new document templates and simplified the number of design decisions that needed to be made with each document.

								<h2 class="portfolio-sectionheader">The Product Logo</h2>
								<p class="portfolio-body">When I joined Kareo, our Billing Company product did not have a distinct brand. So the first step was to create a product logo. I worked with one of our product designers to come up with a logo that was in line with the our existing product logos. Each product logo communicates at two levels. The first level is literal- (i.e. Kareo Clinical is a band-aid). The second level, the silhouette, is a more abstract signifier (i.e. Kareo Clinical is a cross, signifying hospitals/medical practices). Given that precedent, we chose the following logo, which is a literal representation of a billing company office but also a bar graph, signifying data and analytics, which fits the role of our Billing Companies.</p>

								<h2 class="portfolio-sectionheader">Product Intro</h2>
								<p class="portfolio-body">One of Kareo’s main selling points is the comprehensiveness of our suite of products. Gone are the days when practices have to purchase point solutions from separate companies for each aspect of their practice (electronic health record software from one company, billing software from another, etc.). I wanted to communicate the comprehensiveness of our solutions while simultaneously communicating the integration and simplicity of our platform. I decided the easiest way to communicate this was through abstracted UI from various features and have them converge on our simple interface.</p>

								</section>
								<h2 class="portfolio-sectionheader">Layout: Softening the Transitions</h2>
								<p class="portfolio-body">While the easy approach to any page is to stack vertical blocks of content, I felt we could increase engagement and encourage scrolling by not having as many distinct edges to the bottoms of each section. Furthermore, Kareo’s brand (and logo itself) is comprised of curves, which connotes a feeling of softness and ease. I thought we could extend this brand feeling and language through softer transitions and curves in the page layouts themselves.</p>

								<h2 class="portfolio-sectionheader">Feature Illustrations</h2>
								<p class="portfolio-body">Believe it or not, medical billing software is not the most exciting product to read about. Big surprise! Our original features section was a simple, stale block of descriptions and links and, to no one’s surprise, it didn’t attract much engagement. As I had already used product videos and screenshots in the product overview section above it, I thought the best approach to draw interest as well as communicate the value of our features holistically was to use an animated illustration. Again, we wanted to continue echo the integrated workflow of our platform.</p>

								<h2 class="portfolio-sectionheader">Measuring Our Success</h2>
								<p class="portfolio-body">Making things look pretty is fine and all but did it actually change anything? We set up recordings in Hotjar and found the following: 1) average page scroll length went well past the height of the original page with 25% of users reaching almost the bottom of the page; 2) we increased engagement on our main CTAs (Schedule Demo buttons at the top and bottom of the pages) from 2% in the previous version to 4% in the updated page. Not bad considering we launched ZERO new features!</p>

								<h2 class="portfolio-sectionheader" id="intro-header">Case Study:<br/> The ROI of Outsourcing Your Billing Ebook</h2>
								<p class="portfolio-body" id="intro-paragraph">Print collateral has pros and cons from a visual design perspective. It is liberating to not be weighed down by factors like dealing with multiple display sizes and interactivity in responsive web design. On the other hand, a format like an ebook is limited to one of the most boring dimensions known to man: 8.5 x 11in.</p>
								<h2 class="portfolio-sectionheader">What I Inherited</h2>
								<p class="portfolio-body">Here’s what the previous agency came up with. While the grid is predictable and consistent and easily repeatable, it feels like this document was made 10 years ago- not the kind of tone we want to convey especially for a healthcare software company that is trying to disrupt and innovate an industry that is inundated with poor design as it is.</p>
								<section class="section fade-in outview">
									<img class="portfolio-img" src="portfolio/kareo-ebook-design/ebook2@2x.jpg" />
								</section>
								<h2 class="portfolio-sectionheader">Don’t Be Square</h2>
								<p class="portfolio-body">So I decided to break the grid. Many of these guides were also relatively sparse on content so the grid, which is better utilized for content heavy designs, seemed unnecessary. Instead, I used the negative space of the illustrations to dictate where text should go and the flexible layout allowed us to modulate the emphases of specific points with a level of naturalness and specificity that might have been harder with a strict grid. <br/> With every page I tried to distill down the content to the most important point. Never over designing when unnecessary, spacing the content as it made sense in terms of the flow of the page. And I consulted frequently with our Content Marketing Manager to make sure her point was being told clearly and concisely. I always start these projects with a careful read of the copy, trying to distill each section to the most concise and impactful point. The impact of visuals are commensurate to the quality of the content.</p>								<section class="section fade-in outview">

								<h2 class="portfolio-sectionheader">Illustration</h2>
								<p class="portfolio-body">Echoing our circular shape language created a consistency and distinctiveness to the illustrations and layouts. Everything from the characters to the layouts and even the font style uses a consistent circular treatment.<br/> When it comes to illustrations, more is not always better. Sometimes, well-placed negative space can tell more of a story and add more beauty than a thousand dollar illustration. <br/> We also didn’t have unlimited budget and time for these ebooks, so we had to be able to use our limited illustrative assets and resources in a way that made it feel we were a much better funded design organization.</p>

There was a balancing act in terms of not heavily branding the site as Kareo, while keeping it in the same universe enough that there was a smooth transition when prospects eventually came over to our product site. The biggest challenge on this project was creating the site in a very short time frame with a skeleton crew without compromising on quality.</p>

								<p class="portfolio-body">In 2018, I made a goal for myself to learn to shoot and edit a video from start to finish for the first time. I thought a great first project to take on was a mini-promo/documentary about my friend’s nature meetup group, Adventure Awaits. However, it quickly became very apparent to me why people hire entire crews for these projects.
								<br/>
								But stubbornly, I was committed to learning every aspect of the process (not to mention, I had no interest in shelling out thousands on crew members for a test project). Thankfully, we’re living during a time when our phones can record decent video, and I just needed a couple extra tools to help me.

								<h2 class="portfolio-sectionheader">One Man (Mobile) Crew</h2>
								<p class="portfolio-body">I knew if I was going to spend all this time making this video I at least wanted to get some semblance of a cinematic feeling. Thankfully, when I started this project I entered the nascent market of mobile filmmaking right as companies dedicated to this  niche industry started taking off.
								<br/>
								First off was the gimbal. My sister bought me the Zhiyun Smooth Q, which worked like magic and was an absolute lifesaver. Next, I bought Tele and Wide lenses from a small, up and coming startup called Moment. And finally, I bought a mini external Rode mic as well as a Zoom H1 for interviews. Altogether, my set of equipment was so tiny I was able to fit everything in this bag.

In all my excitement over the technical details, I did not prepare myself as an interviewer. I thought the answers from my unwitting subject would just flow with little prompting but boy was I wrong.</p>

								<h2 class="portfolio-sectionheader" >Post-Production</h2>
								<p class="portfolio-body">Finally, came the most painful but also the most enlightening part of learning the filmmaking process- post-production. The project was a great and brutal introduction to editing and sound design in Premiere Pro and Audition. I, like many viewers and amateur filmmakers of documentaries, completely underestimated how much one has to predetermine the story arc of a documentary prior to even filming one frame. Like everything else in this process, I learned this the hard way as I trashed hours of pretty but unusable footage. <br/>
								After hours of tutorials and studying other documentaries I cobbled together the story of my friend and his meetup group as best as I could and came up with this end result.</p>
